How to setup on a new machine:

1. Set EOS_SCRIPT_PATH as base directory where scripts are located
2. Set BASE_NAME as base directory where output and log files are stored

How to add a new scenario foo with data bar:

1. In scan.bash, add a new variable  SCAN_foo.
2. In constraints.bash, add a new variable CONSTRAINTS_bar.
3. In priors.bash, add a new variable NUISANCE_bar that contains the necessary
   parameters to describe the observables in the constraints.
4. Create a new executable file foo-bar.bash, in which the default options for prerun and main run
   can be overridden.
5. To make predictions, add $PREDICTIONS_bar to predictions.bash.
5. Make the script executable and run the script with

   chmod +x foo-bar.bash
   BASE_NAME=$BASE_NAME/2014-04-11 ./foo-bar.bash pre INDEX

   NOTE: Don't use INDEX=0003, prefer INDEX=3 instead.
6. Check the output in the log file, and make sure all (nuisance!) parameters, constraints etc. appear
7. Getting ready for the prerun: turn down the sample number and update size as in
   export MCMC_PRERUN_SAMPLES=4
   export MCMC_PRERUN_UPDATE_SIZE=4

   then fire it up:

   BASE_NAME=$BASE_NAME/2014-04-11 ./loadleveler-single.cmd scII posthep13hpqcdSLflat pre 0 5

   Make sure all files are fine, then turn up the volume and resubmit.
