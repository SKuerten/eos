How to add a new scenario foo with data bar:

1. In scan.bash, add a new variable  SCAN_foo.
2. In constraints.bash, add a new variable CONSTRAINTS_bar.
3. In priors.bash, add a new variable NUISANCE_bar that contains the necessary
   parameters to describe the observables in the constraints.
4. Create a new executable file foo_bar.bash, in which the default options for prerun and main run
   can be overridden.
5. Start the script with ./foo_bar.bash pre INDEX
   NOTE: Don't use INDEX=0003, prefer INDEX=3 instead
